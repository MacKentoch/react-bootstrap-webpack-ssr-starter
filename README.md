### ReactJS + Bootstrap starter + react router v4 + webpack 2 with server side rendering (and hot reload for front dev)

## Concept behind

This is a port of existing starter [react-bootstrap-webpack-starter](https://github.com/MacKentoch/react-bootstrap-webpack-starter) where I added `server side rendering`.

## Detailed Content

**Front:**
- React JS (15.5.x - [github :link:](https://github.com/facebook/react))
- react-router (v4- [github :link:](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router))
- Bootstrap (3.x - [github :link:](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap))
- React-Bootstrap ([github :link:](https://github.com/react-bootstrap/react-bootstrap))
- font-awesome ([github :link:](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome))
- animate.css ([github :link:](https://github.com/daneden/animate.css))
- classnames ([github :link:](https://github.com/JedWatson/classnames))
- react-motion ([github :link:](https://github.com/chenglou/react-motion))
- Webpack 2.x ([github :link:](https://github.com/webpack/webpack))
- babel 6+ ([github :link:](https://github.com/babel/babel))
- axios ([github :link:](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios) *Why: simple, complete, isomorphic ...*)

**Tool chain:**
- babel 6+
- eslint
- webpack 2.x
- hot reload
- loaders
  - `js` / `jsx`
  - sass
  - css
  - json
  - images formats
  - svg and fonts formats
- postcss (postcss-next)

**tests:**
- Mocha
- Chai (*+ dirty-chai*)
- enzyme
- Sinon
- nyc


## Usage

### Install

```bash
npm install
```

Or yarn way:

```bash
yarn install
```
### bundle dev mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

### dev : hot reload mode

```bash
npm run start
```

### tests

```bash
npm run test
```

### bundle production mode


```bash
npm run prod
```

### serve single page application

```bash
npm run serve-spa
```
 Note: it is the same as `npm run serve` but it automatically run a prod bundle before starting server

### serve server side rendering

```bash
npm run serve-ssr
```
